      <h3>Apples</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
        Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species
        in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
        Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
        years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists.
        Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse,
        Greek, and European Christian tradition. (text source via Wikipeida).

      <h3>Banana</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry[1][2] – produced by
        several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.[3] In some
        countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them
        from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is
        usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind,
        which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. The fruits grow upward
         in clusters nearthe top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp)
         bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific
         names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa ×
         paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their
         genomic constitution. The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum,
         is no longer used.(text source via Wikipeida).

      <h3>Strawberry</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely
        grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries,
        which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for
        its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is
        consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice,
        pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas
        are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.

      <h3>Kiwi</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
        Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi in North America and continental Europe) or
        Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the
        genus Actinidia.[1][2] The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (Actinidia
        deliciosa 'Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg: 5–8
        centimetres (2–3 inches) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1+3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) in diameter.
        It has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green
        or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
        texture with a sweet and unique flavour.(text source via Wikipeida).
